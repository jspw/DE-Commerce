# Dynamic E-Commerce

## Intro

Dynamic E-Commerce is basically a simple E-Commerce application where customer can view products as well as categories and order their chosen products.

As an intern in DSinnovators we are going through some session (**javascript**, **react** for now) and some tasks are given by our mentor (Yousha vai). This was one of them.

So far, I have implemented ->

- Home page (`/`)
  - Search Product based on product and category
- Single Product View (`/product/:product-title`)
- Category Products View (`/category/:category`)
- Order Checkout Page (`/checkout`)
- Order Complete Page (`/order-complete`)
- 404 Error Page (`/*`)

## About Task

```

You are to prepare the frontend of an e-commerce website.
Requirements
Clone this frontend https://e-commerce-frontend-react.netlify.app/
Tools needed to be used:
React
Context Api
fetch/axios
Routing
Tailwind css
localStorage for data persistence
You are to write a custom hook to fetch the data from server and save it in your localstorage so that you dont make any network calls next time you show the products list.
Suggestions
UI should be beautiful, buttery smooth and super responsive
While showing the products in a row, you should insert a mechanism to control the number of products you want to show per row, as it should be consistent throughout the application
Make sure the overall UX is stimulating and raises minimum questions
